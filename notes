should be able to load a matchlist,

but you should also be able to switch between matchlists to match expectationis.

for example, I want a call to address a to return a successful result, but I also want to resturn a bad result, so I ccan test what happens when you run different results.

so what these things called?

a matchlist...

a dictionary.

change dictionary.

change responses

responseList

changeResponse.

set the response list.

a response list is just a list of addresses and response files

responses

routes

responses


the app opens the default routes file if one exists, or none if there is none.
